# PasswordGenerator
I am creating a random password generator that allows the user to select criteria such: password length and whether to include numbers, symbols, uppercase lettering or lowercase lettering.

This project uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

By collecting user input, the password is generated by randomly selecting a value from an array that is concat'ed with only options the user selects via a confirmation prompt. A for loop then runs as many time as the user's desired password length, which is collected and validated with a prompt. The user may then click the "Generate Password" button to apply their new password to a text area that allows them to copy and paste to use in authentication processes.
